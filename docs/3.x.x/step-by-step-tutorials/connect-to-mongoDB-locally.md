# Connect Strapi to MongoDB locally

This tutorial is a detailed step-by-step instruction on connecting and using a [community version MongoDB database](https://www.mongodb.com/) with your [Strapi headless CMS](https://strapi.io/). Please complete the [Strapi installation instructions](/3.x.x/step-by-step-tutorials/install-strapi-globally.html#install-strapi-globally) prior to continuing to install **MongoDB**.

Unlike other databases, if you would like to use MongoDB in production with Strapi, you must also use a MongoDB installation in your development environment. 

Let's go ahead now and install MongoDB and then create a new local **Strapi Project**. 

## Install MongoDB on your development environment

For the purposes of this tutorial, we will review the installation steps for MongoDB on a Windows 10, Mac O/S (Mojave) and Linux Ubuntu 18.04. (You may always check the official [MongoDB documentation](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/#tutorial-installation), should you have a different O/S or if you have any additional questions.)

**WINDOWS 10**

### Install MongoDB on Windows 10

Follow these steps to [install MongoDB onto your Windows 10](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-windows/) environment (The Windows Sub-System for Linux (WSL) is unsupported by MongoDB):

1. Download the `MongoDB Community Edition` for Windows [here](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center/community?jmp=docs). You will need to ensure the following is showing on the download page:
    - Select the server you would like to run : `MongoDB Community Server`
    - Version : `4.x.x` 
    - OS : `Windows 64-bit x64`
    - Package : `MSI`

    Now you can click the `Download` button.


2. Run the MongoDB installer by _double-clicking_ the (.msi) file you downloaded, then complete each step of the MongoDB Community Edition installation wizard:
    - Click `Next` from the _Welcome Screen_
    - Accept the _Terms and Conditions_, click `Next`
    - Choose Setup Type : `Complete`
    - Service Configuration : 
        - Check the box `Install MongoDB as a Service` 
        - Select `Run service as Network Service User`
        - The Service name should read : `MongoDB`
        - Continue with the default installation of the `Data` and `Log` directories.
        - Click `Next`

4. You may choose _NOT_ to install _MongoDB Compass_, by unchecking `Install MongoDB Compass`, otherwise click `Next`.

5. Click `Install`, and let MongoDB finish installing. When it is complete, click `Finish`.

6. Let's start the `mongod` background service.  Open a new command line window and navigate to the following directory and then execute the `mongod` command:

```bash
C:\>
C:\> cd Program Files\MongoDB\Server\4.0\bin
C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\4.0\bin>mongod
```

7. Open up another new command line window so that you can access the `mongo shell`. In the new command line window, navigate to the following directory and then execute the `mongo` command:  

```bash
C:\>
C:\> cd Program Files\MongoDB\Server\4.0\bin
C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\4.0\bin>mongo
```

You are now in the mongo shell.  You can exit the shell by typing `CTRL + C` from the shell command line.

You have now installed MongoDB onto your development environment. You are now ready to set-up and [configure Strapi to use MongoDB locally](#install-strapi-with-mongodb).

::: mac
**MAC O/S 10.14 MOJAVE**

### Install MongoDB on Mac

Follow these steps to [install MongoDB onto your Mac](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-os-x/) developer environment:

1. From your terminal, use `brew` to tap the official MongoDB formula repository and add it to the formula list:

```bash
brew tap mongodb/brew
```

2. From your terminal, now install MongoDB

```bash
brew install mongodb-community@4.0
```

3. In order to connect and use MongoDB, we first need to get the `mongod` process running and then we can open the `mongo` shell. In your terminal:

```bash
mongod --config /usr/local/etc/mongod.conf
mongo
```
You are now in the mongo shell.  You can exit the shell by typing `CTRL + C` from the shell command line.

You have now installed MongoDB onto your development environment. You are now ready to set-up and [configure Strapi to use MongoDB locally](#install-strapi-with-mongodb).

::: ubuntu
**UBUNTU 18.04**

### Install MongoDB on Ubuntu

Follow these steps to [install MongoDB onto your Ubuntu](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/install-on-linux/) environment:

1. From your terminal, you will need to import a public key to ensure your MongoDB is authentic (You can verify the GPG key [here](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-ubuntu/).): 

```bash
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80 --recv 9DA31620334BD75D9DCB49F368818C72E52529D4
```

2. Ubuntu requires the creation of a list file for MongoDB. It is found here `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/mongodb-org-4.0.list`. Each Ubuntu major version (14.04, 16.04, 18.04) has a different list.  The following command is for **18.04**.  Other versions of Ubuntu require a different package found [here](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-ubuntu/).

```bash
echo "deb [ arch=amd64 ] https://repo.mongodb.org/apt/ubuntu bionic/mongodb-org/4.0 multiverse" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mongodb-org-4.0.list
```

3. Reload the local package database from your terminal:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
```

4. Install the stable release MongoDB package

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y mongodb-org
```

5. In order to connect and use MongoDB, we first need to get the mongod process running and then we can open the `mongo` shell. In your terminal:

```bash
sudo service mongod start
mongo

```
You are now in the mongo shell.  You can exit the shell by typing `CTRL + C` from the shell command line.

You have now installed MongoDB onto your development environment. You are now ready to set-up and [configure Strapi to use MongoDB locally](#install-strapi-with-mongodb).

## Install Strapi with MongoDB

### Create a new project

We will use `strapi new cms` in the command line to create a project. The command will automatically create a Strapi `cms` project folder within your parent `Projects/` directory. You can replace the `cms` project name with any name you want.

```bash
strapi new cms
```

You will see something like this:

```bash
üöÄ Start creating your Strapi application. It might take a minute, please take a coffee ‚òïÔ∏è

? Choose your installation type (Use arrow keys)
‚ùØ Quickstart (recommended) 
  Custom (manual settings) 
```
Use your `down arrow` key and select `Custom (manual settings)` and press `enter`:

```bash
? Choose your installation type 
  Quickstart (recommended) 
‚ùØ Custom (manual settings) 
```

Select `MongoDB` and press `enter`:

```bash
? Choose your installation type Custom (manual settings)
? Choose your main database: 
  SQLite 
‚ùØ MongoDB 
  MySQL 
  Postgres 
``` 

Next, you will be asked to create a new `Database name`. **Note:** MongoDB must be running in the background (see above).

If you leave this field empty, Strapi will use the name of the folder, in this case `cms`. If you have an existing MongoDB database already created, enter it here or enter a different name as you choose.  We will accept the `default` name. 

```bash
? Choose your installation type Custom (manual settings)
? Choose your main database: MongoDB
? Database name: (cms) 

```

Press `enter`.

Select the remaining default options for installing Strapi with MongoDB - just press `enter`.  It will look something like this including install:

```bash

? Choose your installation type Custom (manual settings)
? Choose your main database: MongoDB
? Database name: cms
? Host: 127.0.0.1
? +srv connection: false
? Port (It will be ignored if you enable +srv): 27017
? Username: 
? Password: 
? Authentication database (Maybe "admin" or blank): 
? Enable SSL connection: false

‚è≥ Testing database connection...
The app has been connected to the database successfully!

‚ö°Ô∏è Start application:
$ strapi start

```
